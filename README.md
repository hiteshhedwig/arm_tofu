# Robotic arm webot

Purpose of this repo is to establish several proof of concept and some learning elements.
1. Control robotic arm manually on the keypad
2. Control via gamepad controller with inverse kinematics implementation.
3. Change the plane and setup of the simuation and detect bins
4. use gamepad controller for pick and drop the manipulation
5. Now use external real work camera to control the basic gripping function  open and close to be rendered in the simulation
6. extend the usage for more creative stuffs
